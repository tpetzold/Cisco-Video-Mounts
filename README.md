I’ve been working with my team on creating temporary mounting solutions for Cisco Cameras. We often must set up a space to demonstrate Cisco Video Endpoints in a customer conference room where we can’t mount cameras to the walls. I was working with my team and someone suggested using Speaker stands which are inexpensive and light but also sturdy.

I worked through several revisions with this current revision using all the built-in mounting hardware so you don’t have to remove anything from the cameras, and you can use the quick connects to quickly and easily mount and remove the cameras from the mounts for assembly and disassembly.

I’ve used FilaCube PLA 2 in black as I’ve found it prints well but any filament would do. PETG would work well and the PTZ4K mount with its large flat surface could easily use a glass or carbon infused filament as those tend to warp less for large flat pieces.

These are designed to fit a standard speaker stand. The one’s I choose are: [Gemini Sound ST-Pack Heavy Duty Professional Audio Universal DJ Fold-Out Telescoping Tripod Steel Speaker Stands (Set of 2)](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00TUBQ4NM?ref_=ppx_hzsearch_conn_dt_b_fed_asin_title_1)

I chose these because they are a little taller than some others I looked at and they come in pairs in a handy travel bag. However, I believe that most speakers stands use a 35mm pole which is what these mounts are designed to use.

The extrusions for the Quad Camera and Bar Pro mount are standard 2040 aluminum extrusions. I used 500mm length but you could get away with 400mm for the Quad camera, but the Bar Pro needs the 500mm. I chose these: [IXGNIJ 2pcs 500mm V Slot 2040 Aluminum Extrusion](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08X4NH88C?ref_=ppx_hzsearch_conn_dt_b_fed_asin_title_4&th=1) but any would do. You also need T Nuts and M5x8mm screws. A kit like [200pcs 2020 Series M5 T Nut and Black Screw Kit](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F1BWQ35S?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title&th=1) should provide all the T Nuts and screws for 4 camera mounts.

Other hardware required:

M3x12 counter sink screws and nuts  
M3x16 counter sink screws

Something like [binifiMux M3 Screws Kit, 360pcs](https://www.amazon.com/binifiMux-360pcs-Countersunk-Phillips-Machine/dp/B08N5XDHMW/ref=sr_1_19?crid=196P290IBFZDR&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.gvzEjpHlUXtRUJxoEfy2LEpecrorXRa4U0AvonuZ68bGjHj071QN20LucGBJIEps.9mlZXTiWlhKVkd_YZJyZ39y5lbTpo9xxlc2fpYTdqK8&dib_tag=se&keywords=m3+m4+countersunk+screws+black&qid=1747083121&sprefix=m3+m4+countersunk+screws+black%2Caps%2C103&sr=8-19&xpid=uafD1Rm0VqlS3)  will do 3 mounts and multiple Quad Cameras

M4x20 socket cap screws and nuts

Something like [382 Pieces Black M4 x 5/6 /8/10 /12/16 /20mm Button Head Socket Cap Screws](https://www.amazon.com/Kindroufly-Pieces-Button-Washers-Assortment/dp/B0BLCFZ2KL/ref=sr_1_8?crid=3M30G8GZV1OEE&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.b0HHZ39JgsBpPYjmkLwl92Ivk26csVFY0yC5r_z9v5oVA62XsyY91GPJ-KK7uyIUujUV6q1FLBVjKb94RvyiIpXlmzHRI8gDvjJx5gsmsDE2z4Uty4XrHg_-wP9xyZkDo0JytrLxNgiGr8ROZ_Kj-BkNtN4tUjzkxPBpp_ViEa-1XF5vDv2mEG1eVDyWoRpbJLVUXFtOO378lAQgps2cmrxMmpNhBwBK-Xfd03TIeSA._ytW4avdIe9tStc7Hfv0c5EEFIKOrgDsycMK60EF1xs&dib_tag=se&keywords=m4%2Bcap%2Bbutton%2Bhead%2Bblack&qid=1747083315&sprefix=m4%2Bcap%2Bbutton%2Bhead%2Bblack%2Caps%2C63&sr=8-8&th=1)

I also have 3D printed endcaps but those are available as well from amazon just search 2040 end caps

Finally, I made cable management clips. There are two sizes, one for the 35mm pole and legs and a larger one for the bottom center post. They’re designed to work with ½ inch Velcro cable ties like these: [VELCRO Brand ONE-WRAP Cable Ties](https://www.amazon.com/VELCRO-Brand-Cable-Ties-100Pk/dp/B001E1Y5O6/ref=sr_1_3?crid=2FYXRVCLYZWOJ&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.ZAKfKMsw_2U1hbNzmOiwzzNji4V6h5SkEAPVWpMRLoYjMO3F4WsEKNZnyGt933ecs1MivWP-S5dCBeoBNwyP68ziO-6BvaqLQnPbpS0RPbDqnXZNOrunYAHMrOA0b4RIJHK-beeENVVmSA4sUUkfkBwjVhyahlQCLUpOQN25E5gwD6lFI5jgSrV7NMEGVxSUvOSdqeKNokQ4u2wJSZOU98-60xbf8pZsUGNUAlxApx74K9bYUQ5gJso0Djbybogb8ftHvs5HQx4TCsNUvBs1h-bbHoFrIv0qOYygMD5xwlU.8aC4z_CqGvatln9z4Mw0B6uyRthOeNnLoLNNCGIiYCU&dib_tag=se&keywords=electronic%2Bcable%2Bties&qid=1747083450&rdc=1&s=industrial&sprefix=electronic%2Bcable%2Btie%2Cindustrial%2C143&sr=1-3&th=1)
